    "1. An API is a set of protocols and routines for building and interacting with software applications.\n",
    "2. API is an acronym and is short for Application Program interface.\n",
    "3. It is common to pull data from APIs in the JSON file format.\n",

    "Note: recently, OMDB has changed their API: you now also have to specify an API key. This means you'll have to add another argument to the URL: `apikey=ff21610b`.\n",
